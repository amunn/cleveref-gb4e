# cleveref-gb4e

This package simply sets up `cleveref` and `gb4e` so that `cleveref` knows about the various counters that `gb4e` uses. 

Lightly tested, it works for the basic `{exe}` and `{xlist}` environments. 

## Usage: 

    \usepackage{cleveref-gbe4}

It loads `cleveref` with the `[sort&compress]` option, so it’s best to let the package load it rather than you loading it. The `gb4e` package will also be loaded, and so doesn’t need to be separately loaded.

Released under the LPPL Licence (see code for details.)
